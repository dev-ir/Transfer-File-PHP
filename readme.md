# File Upload from URL Script

## Description
This script is written in PHP and allows downloading a file from a specified URL and saving it on the server. To successfully execute this script, the user must enter a valid password.

## Usage
1. Upload the script to your server.
2. Open the script URL in a browser.
3. Enter the file URL you wish to download in the input field.
4. Enter the correct password (12348).
5. Click the **Up** button.

If the entered information is correct, the file will be stored in the root directory of the server.

## Requirements
- A server with PHP enabled.
- Write permissions in the directory where the script is executed.

## Security Notes
- This script is vulnerable due to the use of a fixed password. It is recommended to use a stronger authentication system.
- Input validation is not performed, making it susceptible to attacks such as **Injection**.
- It is not recommended to use this script in public environments unless its security is improved.

## Suggested Improvements
- Store and validate passwords using hashed values.
- Restrict the types of files that can be downloaded.
- Add logging to monitor activities.
